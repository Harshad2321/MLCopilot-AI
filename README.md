## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MLCopilot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from main import MLCopilot

# Your model and optimizer
model = YourModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Initialize MLCopilot
copilot = MLCopilot(model, optimizer)
copilot.start()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        loss = train_step(batch)
        
        # Log and check for issues
        if copilot.log_and_check(loss):
            break  # Issue detected - recommendations displayed
    
    copilot.log_epoch_end()

copilot.stop()
```

### Run Demo

```bash
# See MLCopilot detect a failing training scenario
python examples/failing_training.py

# See MLCopilot monitor a healthy training scenario
python examples/normal_training.py
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Monitoring Layer**
- Attaches PyTorch hooks to capture gradients
- Logs loss, gradient norms, learning rate, parameter statistics
- Stores metrics in circular buffer (last 1000 batches)

### 2. **Detection Layer**
- Runs rule-based detectors on collected metrics
- Each detector returns confidence score + severity
- Detectors include:
  - `detect_exploding_gradients()` - grad_norm > threshold
  - `detect_vanishing_gradients()` - grad_norm < 1e-7
  - `detect_loss_divergence()` - loss > 2x initial loss
  - `detect_loss_plateau()` - loss unchanged for 50+ batches
  - `detect_nan_loss()` - NaN or Inf in loss
  - `detect_overfitting()` - val_loss >> train_loss

### 3. **Analysis Layer**
- Infers root cause using expert rules
- Considers:
  - Model architecture (depth, normalization)
  - Optimizer config (learning rate, momentum)
  - Training context (batch number, loss history)
- Categories:
  - Hyperparameter issues
  - Model architecture issues
  - Optimization issues
  - Data issues
  - Numerical instability

### 4. **Recommendation Layer**
- Generates specific, actionable fixes
- Includes:
  - Current vs suggested values
  - Code examples
  - Reasoning
  - Expected impact
- Prioritized by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)

### 5. **CLI Reporter**
- Formats output with colors and emojis
- Displays:
  - Detection results with metrics
  - Diagnosis with reasoning
  - Recommendations with code
- Clean, demo-ready output

## 🎓 Example Output

When training with a learning rate that's too high:

```
======================================================================
🚨 TRAINING FAILURE DETECTED
======================================================================

Issue: Gradient norm (157.30) exceeds threshold (10.00)
Type: Exploding Gradients
Severity: CRITICAL
Confidence: 95%
Detected at: Epoch 0, Batch 3

📊 Metrics at Detection
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  • Loss: 245873728.000000
  • Gradient Norm: 157.301453
  • Learning Rate: 5.00e-01
  • Param Mean: 0.124523
  • Param Std: 0.453621

🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Category: Hyperparameter
Primary Cause: Learning rate too high

Reasoning:
The learning rate (0.5) is very high, causing weight updates to 
overshoot. Large learning rates can cause gradients to explode as 
the optimizer takes steps that are too large in parameter space.

Contributing Factors:
  • Learning rate (0.5) exceeds recommended threshold
  • Gradient norm reached 157.30

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

3 actionable fix(es) suggested:

[1] 🔴 CRITICAL - Reduce Learning Rate
    Category: Hyperparameter
    Current:  0.5
    Suggested: 0.05

    High learning rate is causing unstable weight updates. Reducing 
    it by 10x will help stabilize training.

    Code Example:
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.05)

    Expected Impact: Should immediately stabilize gradient norms and 
    prevent divergence

[2] 🟠 HIGH - Enable Gradient Clipping
    Category: Optimization
    Current:  None
    Suggested: max_norm=1.0

    Gradient clipping prevents gradients from growing too large...
```

## 🧪 Detection Thresholds

Configurable thresholds in `types.py`:

```python
class DetectionThresholds:
    EXPLODING_GRAD_THRESHOLD = 10.0
    VANISHING_GRAD_THRESHOLD = 1e-7
    LOSS_DIVERGENCE_MULTIPLIER = 2.0
    LOSS_PLATEAU_THRESHOLD = 0.001
    LOSS_PLATEAU_WINDOW = 50
    HIGH_LR_THRESHOLD = 0.1
    OVERFITTING_GAP_THRESHOLD = 0.5
```
